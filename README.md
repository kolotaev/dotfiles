# My dotfiles

## What is it?
I assume you know what dotfiles are. If yet not, go ahead and google it!

This one is a collection of common dotfiles I stumbled across while surfing github and those emerged from my day-to-day work.

## Installation
Just run `install.sh` from root of this repo on your local machine.

Script will install all the dotfiles to your home directory and backup already pre-existing ones, if any.

## Removal
Just run `uninstall.sh` from root of this repo on your local machine.

Script will remove all the installed dotfiles from your home directory and restore backup-ed ones, if any.

Simple as that.

## What else
Ah yes, and one of that shiny hipster terminal windows you adore so much!
